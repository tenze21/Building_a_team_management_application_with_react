# React Learning. (July 28, 2024)

## Overview.
I have started learning **React** earlier than I planned because I ended up participating in the UNDP hackathon and they recommend using **React** or **Angular** or **Vue** for frontend. This is my first react project and I have created a team management system where the manager can divide their employees into various groups and it was done on repl. I have used local storage to keep tract of the team distribution.

## Tech Stack.
- React.
- Vite.
- CSS.
- Bootstrap.

## Learning.
- After doing this project I got a basic idea of react components.
- I also got some idea of the `usestate` and `useEffect` hooks.
- I also learned about routing in react.
- Now I have a general idea of how react works.

## Resources.
- [Official React website](https://react.dev/)
- [React JavaScript Framework for Beginners â€“ Project-Based Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gSSpfsoOQ&t=6613s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org): I have build the above application by following along this turorial on freeCodeCamp. Here three well experienced developers teach you react through a project based approach where each of them helps you build an application.
